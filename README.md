# Helpradar
We were not the only ones seeing the sheer amount of civil initiatives being organised in the wake of this growing Corona pandemic. A need for clarity and insight in who is doing what, where, when, why and how is fairly obvious.
Our conversations with a professional in crisis management made clear there is a need to gain insight in all these civil initiatives on a meta level for two reasons: A) aiding in evaluating scenarios in the decision making proces by providing more situational awareness and B) quickly identifying where professional organisations could provide assistance to (growing) initiatives.

## Vision
This is a time where people offer all kinds of help from intrinsic motivation. We are eager for a world where people cocreate for the greater good and from this energising intrinsic motivation.

## Mission
The primary objective of this mission is essentially what bringing government & professionals closer to civil initiatives in effectively combatting this (and other) crisis.

On the secondary side we also want to be one of these initiatives that ride on this collective wave of energy. And by fulfilling the actual need showing all the great things people can bring when they chime in together to create and/or offer what the world needs. We hope love this to be one of the many examples that will motivate people to collaborate on larger scale once all this is over.
